                <p>
                    Earlier this year (January 2018). I started to think about how I could improve <br>
                    my design skills and attract more customers. I wanted to start designing <br>
                    some ideas that for a long time I had only on paper and stored on my cell <br>
                    phone, I decided to look for some challenge, something that makes more <br>
                    sense with what I thought. I saw that many designers (especially in dribbble) <br>
                    made a daily user interface, I really liked the idea, but the problem was that <br>
                    the result was just something nice and did not solve any problem.
